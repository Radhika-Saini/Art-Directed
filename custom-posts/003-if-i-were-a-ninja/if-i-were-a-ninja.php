  <h1>If I were <i>a</i><span>Ninja</span></h1>
  
  <div class="stanza left">
    <h2>Stealth</h2>
    <p>If I were a Ninja I'd be dark and silent, You wouldn't know I was there but I would be RIGHT THERE. And then If you looked I'd be gone, cause Ninjas are like, fast. Real fast.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stanza right">
    <h2>Speed</h2>
    <p>I would be fast like woah. You would ask me to chop up some tomatoes for the quesedillas and then they would be done. I took out my ninja sword and chopped em all up, but to you it looked like I just stood there.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stanza left">
    <h2>Magic</h2>
    <p>I use magic and stuff to get the job done. If you piss me off I just teleport a dragon in to bite you. I got my spells from an ancient scroll and its pretty heavy stuff. I'd be hella into the mystical black ninja arts and gangster rap.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stanza right">
    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    <p>If I were a Ninja I would have a whole arsenal of awesome weapons to flip out and merc you with. I got a long blade carved from a dragons tooth, throwing stars made from baby sea lions, and nunchaku made from the bones of ancient emporors. My favorite weapon is my bee bomb. It's a bomb with bees in it. They sting real bad.</p>

  <div class="stanza left">
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <p>You may think being a ninja is all about being able to kick really high, but did you know that ninjas can split themselves into two? If I was a ninja I would have awesome skills, like teleportaion and flight. I would basicly be invisible all the time, and I could make sushi real good. Secret ingredient: ninja poison.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="stanza right">
    <h2>Mind Powers</h2>
    <p>If I was a ninja you would loose when we play monopoly becasue I would use my ninja hypnotics on you. I would buy up all the boardwalk and charge $6 for a hotdog. I would call it Chicago Style, but its really just a hotdog with some pepper and onions on it.</p>
